My name is Karol. I come from Poland where I was born and bred. More or less, I've got 15 years experience in IT industry. I work as a Linux Administrator and I've been doing that job for around 13 years now. More often than not, I spent lots of time at my black screen and making all things work well. Beyond that, I'm keen on experimenting  with a plenty of software technologies cause make me fun. I find it really absorbing and besides if you want master something new you have to devote a good deal of time and just play with it ðŸ˜Š

Nowadays,  I'm increasing my knowledge in DevOps field ðŸš€ casue I'm kind of person who wants to always be developing to become better and achieve more.
I believe in a practical approach where the best way of learning is learning by having fun and constant experimenting with that, searching, asking questions, re-checking, searching even do not know what exactly.
