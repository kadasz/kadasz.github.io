My name is Karol. I come from Poland where I was born and bred. More or less, I've got 15 years experience in IT industry. I work as a Linux Administrator and I've been doing that job for around 13 years now. More often than not,  I spent lots of time at my black screen and making all things work well. Beyond that,  I'm keen on experimenting  with a plenty of software technologies cause make me fun. I find it really absorbing and besides if you want master something new you have to devote a good deal of time and just play with it ðŸ˜Š

Nowadays,  I'm increasing my knowledge in DevOps field casue I'm kind of person who wants to always be developing to become better and achieve more.
A apart from that in SysOps filed we are stuck in a rut because what can we do more when it comes to administrating system? C'mon let's be honest? Nothing unusual in my humble opinion but unlike the technology continues to improve and many things are changed in this field we need to adopt and follow by that in a way. So the answer for that could be DevOps. We should to change the mind and take a right direction because it seems to be common sense - it's my small think about it.
